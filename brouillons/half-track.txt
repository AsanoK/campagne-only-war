Greyhound Halftrack

A simple vehicle, the Greyhound is well loved by the many soldiers who use it for its ruggedness and decent level of protection (against small arms fire; anything else tears through them like paper). The vehicle is a boxy, open topped truck with long treads replacing the back wheels of the vehicle. This allows it good turning ability on roads and other built up terrain, but still gives it excellent off road characteristics for a vehicle of its type and weight.
